# Awesome TI Docs
A collection of awesome calculator documentation resources and tools from all over the web, all in one place. Contributions welcome.

## How to Use
This branch can be used to host static copies of other documentation sources. Some reasons you'd want to transfer something here include

- it's currently hosted on an old or unmaintained site,
- it's on a Google Doc or other collaborative editing site that may not be safe from modification or removal, or
- it can't be found anywhere else on the web.

Of course, you are also welcome to host resources in your own repositories.

See `for_documentation.md` for an example of a Google Doc converted into a static Markdown file and linked on the main README.
