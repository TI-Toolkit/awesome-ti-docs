Cellsheet uses small font 0x24 (`$` in small font, `‚Å¥` in large) as its `$` instead of 0xF2 `$`.

Small font 0x06 ` ` (4-pixel space on mono, 8-pixels on color) is used in the status bar on the CE.

On monochrome calculators the only use of font character 0xDE `))` is in the `Logistic` interface to fit the entire equation ` y=c/(1+ae^(~bx))` on a single line.  Despite the screen being wider, color screen models continue to use 0xDE in this interface.
